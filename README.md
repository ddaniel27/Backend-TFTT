## ðŸ”Œ Endpoints
_Save your data and retrieve your users._

### /api/login
_This endpoint only allows posts request_
#### POST(body): token
The request needs a JSON body content as following:
   ```json
"email": "emailCredential",
"password": "passwordCredential"
```
And will return an **authentication token** if the login is successful.

### /api/infouser
_This endpoint allows to save user data, consult, update and delete that data._

_We will use `userObject` to refeer the model of an user, so refer to this table when needed:_

| _Field_     | _type_   | _required_ | _assignable_  |
|:-----------:|:--------:|:----------:|:-------------:|
| email       | `String` | `true`     | `true`        |
| firstname   | `String` | `true`     | `true`        |
| lastname    | `String` | `true`     | `true`        |
| wallet      | `String` | `true`     | `true`        |
| country     | `String` | `false`    | `true`        |
| city        | `String` | `false`    | `true`        |
| address     | `String` | `false`    | `true`        |
| zipcode     | `String` | `false`    | `true`        |
| phone       | `Number` | `false`    | `true`        |
| countryCode | `String` | `false`    | `true`        |
| created_at  | `Date`   | `false`    | `false`       |
| upddated_at | `Date`   | `false`    | `false`       |

_If a field is **required** means that it needs to exists with a non falsy value in the new user._
_If a field is **assignable** means that it can be saved in a new user._
_The **email** field needs to be unique._
